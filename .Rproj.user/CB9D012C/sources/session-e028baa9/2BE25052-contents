My third paper, finally published. I say this with a heavy sense of relief, as this has been a particularly arduous and tricky one to write. In this theoretical review, we discuss the cognitive black box problem in sleep and decision-making research, highlight complications for the field arising from black box statistical analyses, and demonstrate the viability of implementing computational models as a way to provide higher-resolution findings and push the sleep + decision-making field toward better rigor and clarity. 

As much as it has been a journey writing this, I hope you will find it an enjoyable yet thought-provoking reading experience. I cannot express enough gratitude to my supervisors for helping me shape these ideas over the past years and providing me with the resources to put it all in place.
